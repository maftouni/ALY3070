As we wrap up the semester, I want to leave you with one small but meaningful suggestion.

You didn’t just learn tools this term.  
You learned how to **think**, **design**, and **tell stories with data**.

Your final project reflects that.

### ✨ Let it live beyond this class
If you haven’t already, take a few minutes to publish a simple personal website and add your final project as your **first portfolio piece**. This is exactly the kind of work employers look for:
- real data  
- thoughtful visual design  
- clear, intentional communication  

I’ve shared a short guide that walks you through deploying your site in just a couple of minutes.  
No pressure. No perfection. Just a first step.

###  A final thought
You’ve done meaningful work this semester, and I hope you’re proud of it.  
Thank you for the care, curiosity, and effort you brought to this course.

Wishing you a restful break and all the best in what comes next.
